PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today's health-conscious society, individuals are increasingly seeking personalized nutrition guidance that goes beyond generic diet plans. Existing tools often fail to provide real-time adaptability and do not consider the holistic aspects of a person's lifestyle, including cultural preferences, allergies and evolving health conditions. Additionally, dieticians and nutritionists face significant challenges in scaling personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints.

Generative AI offers a transformative opportunity to address these challenges by creating an intelligent, interactive and adaptive virtual nutrition assistant. This project aims to develop "The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant" leveraging state-of-the-art generative AI models to deliver a comprehensive and personalized nutrition experience.
